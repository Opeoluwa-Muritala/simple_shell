# Simple Shell

### Introduction
This repository is a [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Project. The school project consisted in writing a shell in **C**, using a limited number of standard library functions, So Instead we used our own function that we rewrote over the past three month [Here](https://github.com/Opeoluwa-Muritala/alx-low_level_programming/)

The goal in this project was to make us understand how a shell works. To single out some items: what is an *environment*, the difference between *functions* and *system calls*, how to create *processes* using `execve`...

## Usage
In order to run this program,

Clone This Repo

`` git clone https://github.com/Opeoluwa-Muritala/simple_shell ``

compile it with

`gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`.
You can then run it by invoking `./shell` in that same directory.

### How to use it
In order to use this shell, in a terminal, first run the program:
`prompt$ ./shell`
It wil then display a simple prompt and wait for commands.
`$ `
A command will be of the type `$ command`
This shell can handle two types of commands: builtins and normal program.
##### List of built-ins
Currently the list of built-ins:
* `cd` [directory]
Switch to the specified directory (path).
* `env `
Displays the environment variable
* `exit` [exitstatus]
Exit from the program with exitstatus value. 0 by default.
* `getenv` `NAME`
Return the value of the NAME variable if it is in the environment
* `help` [command]
Displays the syntax for the command, or all commands.
* `history`
Displays the last typed user .
* `echo` `[$$]` or `[$?]` or `[$PATH]`
Return pid and exit statue and PATH.
##### Command
Basicly Every Program in `$PATH`
It Support Single Word like `ls`

It Handle Path `ls /tmp`

it Handle Options Like `ls -l`

it Handle All Three Togther Like `ls -l /var `

it Handle Command Path Also Like `/bin/ls` And All The Option And Path Like `/bin/ls -l /var`
it Handles Comments **#**

### Also
* Handle `Ctrl+C`: your shell should not quit when the user inputs `^C`
* If no argument is given to `cd` the command must be interpreted like `cd $HOME`
* handle the command `cd -`
* Handle variables replacement
* Handle the `$?` variable
* Handle the `$$` variable
* Handle The Argument file like `./shell test` Where test is a file filled with command and builtin to excute.
